# Quilt

Quilt is a mod-loader project â€” primarily aimed at Minecraft. It was founded by users and contributors from the Fabric project, as a last-resort
attempt to address the controversies and issues stemming from that project.

Check out the [Quilt Website](https://quiltmc.org/) for more information.
